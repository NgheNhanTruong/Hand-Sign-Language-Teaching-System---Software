It includes 2366 images.
Hand-sign are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -10 and +10 degrees
* Random shear of between -7째 to +7째 horizontally and -7째 to +7째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -30 and +30 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
